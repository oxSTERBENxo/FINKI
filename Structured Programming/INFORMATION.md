This folder was made in 2024. The exercises are numbered as they are on courses, 1.number meaning its the exercise is for the first partial exam 
and 2.number meaning it's for the second/final exam. As of this year, there aren't any exercises about files on the exams which means there is a good
chance one of the exercises will be with recursion. One of the exercises is with matrices and one with strings (char arrays).
