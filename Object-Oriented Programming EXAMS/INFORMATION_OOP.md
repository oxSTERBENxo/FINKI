This folder was made in 2024. 
The exercises are numbered as they are on courses, 1.number meaning its the exercise is for the first partial exam and 2.number meaning it's for the second/final exam.
As of this year, for one of the exercises on the first partial exam there isn't structures but classes and you need to write the main function. For the other exercise 
the main function is given.
For the second partial exam you also need to add code to the main function in one or both the exercises since files were added and you have exeptions.
